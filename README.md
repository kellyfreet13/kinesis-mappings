to edit the keyboard config, you need to load the keyboard as a v-drive
- plug in the keyboard
- press and hold `progm` then press `f1`
- you should see the `ADVANTAGE2` as a v-drive in the file explorer
- delete all existing mappings in `active/qwerty.txt`
- copy+paste the contents of `active/qwerty.txt` from this repo's file to the v-drive file
- save the contents of `qwerty.txt`
- navigate away from that folder in file explorer (otherwise, the "eject" step won't work)
- click "eject" on the v-drive for `ADVANTAGE2` in the file explorer
- exit power user mode (`progm`+`f1`).
